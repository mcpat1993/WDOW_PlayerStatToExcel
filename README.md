# WDOW_PlayerStatToExcel
This project is used to take screenshots from a Walking Dead Our World group and put their values into a spreadsheet so that you can make graphs and gain insight into how much every player is playing.
WDOW is an #AR game where you walk around the real world and fight zombies. To get past certain levels, you'd need to work as a team to all kill a certain amount of zombies. At the time, they didn't have any way of gathering player statistics for each week sprint. After each sprint, if you didn't beat 3 levels, you would be dropped down in ranking. So the more serious players in my group, of which I was included, ended up periodically screenshoting the overall number of kills and some other all time statistics that you were able to see from each group member. By subtracting all of the values of the screenshots from the previous week, you could approximate pretty well how much a member had contributed per week. Of course doing the screenshots and the math for each player in a group for 10 different statistics became quite cumbersome. In order to make my life a little bit easier, I used #pytesseract to recognize the values from the screenshots, associate them with a player, do the math, import them to a continuously growing spreadsheet so I could make graphs showing progress of certain players.
